# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
This project involves scraping off of headlines from news websites and 
the performing name entity recognition to find out keywords. 
Then using these keywords to stream through tweets that are 
being posted in real time and strictly related to these extracted 
keywords to predict the polarity of the tweets that are being posted.
